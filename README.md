# Simple Data Viz
### Visualization Demonstration using Jupyter Notebook
_This Project's Status: **ONGOING**_  
Hi! My name is Sang Putu and this is the repository of my personal project: Data Visualization Demonstration using Jupyter Notebook.

### About this project
This project is about demonstrating simple methods to process and visualizae spreadsheet data using python, dataframe operations, and descriptive visualizations.

### Source
The project's main .csv file is called **HRDataset_v14** and you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). It is a data visualizations practice dataset, provided by Dr. Rich.

### Libraries Used
This project uses libraries for processing our dataset, such as:
 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) for linear algebra
 - [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) Data processing
 - [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) Plotting library
 - [Seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/) Plotting library (colorful visualizations)
 - [Plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/) Plotting library
 - OS File navigation (to access csv, by default is already installed)

### Questions from Dataset
Dr. Rich has included some open-ended questions that analysts can explore and try to address through creating Tableau visualizations, or R or Python analyses:

- Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
- What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
- Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
- Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?

### References
Still on progress for inserting references, stay tuned.
